# WordPress in K12 Environment
A list of K12 schools using WordPress, organized by state. 

I started making this list when researching building a WordPress site for a school district. I wanted to see what else was out there and what had been done. If you have any sites of your own to add, let me know through the issues. 

**Florida** 
- St. Johns County School District - http://www.stjohns.k12.fl.us/

**New Jersey**
- Newark Public Schools - http://www.nps.k12.nj.us/ This is one of the most impressive K12 WordPress setups I've seen.
